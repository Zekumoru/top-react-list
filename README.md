# Handle Inputs And Render Lists - React App

This repository is my take on the assignment from the lesson [Handle Inputs And Render Lists](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-handle-inputs-and-render-lists)

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to apply the knowledge learned from the two previous lessons: [React Introduction](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-react-introduction) and [State and Props](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-state-and-props).

The app contains an input bar and a submit button upon which clicked will produce an element list item containing the text from the input bar and render it along the other list items.
